    Disable Linux Python 2.7 builds
    
    For some reason the Python 2.7 builds are hanging in the tests. Not sure
    why ATM. However it seems reasonable not to waste CI time on them. So
    this skips them.

commit 7f3634bb05e0aced425e89c7f6ae58da45cdf6a3

    Disable Windows builds
    
    Currently all Windows builds either fail due to precision issues in the
    tests (Python 3 primarily) or they stall out during testing until CI
    terminates them (Python 2). Not entirely sure the issues that are
    causing these problems. However both will require a Windows developer
    with a fair bit of experience (and necessary resources) to debug these
    issues. For now it would be nice to save the CI time as far as
    conda-forge is concerned and disable the Windows builds until someone
    can properly fix these issues. Hence this marks the Windows builds as
    skipped until then.

    Now that CircleCI is being used as the macOS build worker provider
    instead of macOS, re-render to refresh the CI files to make disable
    Travis CI and enable macOS builds on CircleCI in addition to the current
    Linux builds.

    As this is timing out on Travis CI's macOS build workers, switch over to
    using CircleCI as the provider of macOS builds.
